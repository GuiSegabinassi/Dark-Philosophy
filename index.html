            <h2>About Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It is distinguished from other ways of addressing such questions by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument. Philosophy has been divided into many sub-fields, including metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic, and aesthetics.</p>
